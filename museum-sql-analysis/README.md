# Museum & Artist SQL Analysis

**Tools:** PostgreSQL, Tableau  
**Category:** Relational Database Design + Visualization

## Overview

In this project, I wrote 3 SQL queries to explore a database of museums, paintings, and artists. I created derived tables and visualized the data using Tableau to identify patterns in artwork distribution and artist representation.

## What I Did

- Created 3 normalized SQL tables: `subject and style`, `artists`, and `museums`
- Used joins, aggregations, CTE's, and subqueries to build insights
- Visualized artwork frequency by country, subject, style, frequency, etc

## Sample Insights

- WORK IN PROGRESS

## Files

- `queries.sql` — SQL queries used to extract and process data
- `museum_dashboard.twbx` — Tableau visual analysis
