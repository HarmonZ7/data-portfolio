## Overview

This Tableau storyboard visualizes how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted food consumption across different industry sectors. It provides a narrative flow through charts and interactive filters to show shifts in dietary trends and production.

## What I Did

- Created a multi-page Tableau storyboard to communicate the story visually
- Highlighted key changes in consumption before, during, and after COVID lockdown periods
- Used time-series charts, bar graphs, and categorical comparisons to emphasize variation across food sectors

## Key Insights

- All food sectors saw an increase of 6%-15% consumption during March, 2020. This coincides with the beginning of lockdown.
  -Meats saw the largest increase with a 15% increase in sales
- However, consumption decreased by 91% across all industries by 2021.
