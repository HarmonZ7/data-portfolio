# Movie Revenue & Budget Analysis

**Tools:** Microsoft Excel  
**Category:** Data Exploration & Visualization

## Overview

This project explores the relationship between movie budgets, scores, genres and box office revenues. Using Excel, I created pivot tables and visual charts to uncover patterns in financial performance across different films and budget tiers.

## Key Insights

-Movie revenues has steadily increased until the economic recession in 2020, even when adjusted for inflation.
-Movie gross revenue has no relation to their score, and has more correlation to their target audience.
-Family friendly movies(PG, PG-13) and TV-MA have the highest gross revenues due to their wider audience bases.
