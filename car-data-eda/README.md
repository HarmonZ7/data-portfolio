# Car Fuel Efficiency EDA

**Tools:** Python, Jupytr Notebook, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
**Category:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of cars to explore what factors impact fuel efficiency (MPG). I used Python libraries to clean the data, perform statistical exploration, and visualize key relationships.

## Key Insights

Our main insights are listed below and are fully visualized in the notebook:

- Cars with a horsepower closer to their desired mpg will have a higher fuel efficiency
- Cars with a lower weight will have a higher fuel efficiency
- Cars from Europe and Japan have consistently demonstrated the highest level of fuel efficiency
- Lastly, fuel efficiency is constantly improving and has shown consistent growth from the period of 1970 to 1982
